A (dev-ware) dashboard where various services I use can be accessed all in one place.

This project is a playground for me to test out a variety of APIs, practice modern JS syntax, and learn about backend dev via NodeJS.

## Setting up API Keys

Enter in API keys for [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/api) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) in the `js/keys-example.js` file. Then, rename the file to `keys.js`.

## Reference stuff
